# Stock-price-prediction
This project aims to predict the price movement of selected Indian stocks (ADANIPORTS, AXISBANK, BAJAJ-AUTO, and RELIANCE) over a 6-month horizon using historical stock data. Various machine learning models are explored and evaluated for their performance in classifying future stock movements into 'Up', 'Down', or 'Sideways'.
