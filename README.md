# 📈 Stock Price Prediction: From Market Crash to Machine Learning

A lot of people in India invest in stocks, hoping to build a second income. What many don’t realize early on is how risky it can be without proper guidance.

I saw this firsthand. My parents used to invest based on broker tips, and I followed suit in early 2008—just before the global crash. I lost most of my investment out of fear, and my parents took a hit too. It took me nearly a decade to regain confidence in the markets.

Today, I approach investing differently—guided by data, fundamentals, and long-term thinking. And now, I’ve taken it a step further by applying machine learning to stock prediction.

## 🧠 Project Overview: Predicting Stock Movement After 6 Months

Together with my friend [[Aditya Rathore](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditya-rathore-8189b421a/)) and mentor [Rajeev Ranjan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajeev-ranjan4j/), we built a model to classify stock movement after 6 months as:

- 📈 **Up** (> +15%)
- 📉 **Down** (< –15%)
- ➡️ **Sideways** (between –15% and +15%)

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights

### 📊 Data Source
- NIFTY-50 daily stock data (2000–2021) from NSE India
- Stocks used: `ADANIPORTS`, `AXISBANK`, `BAJAJ-AUTO`, `RELIANCE`

### 🧹 Preprocessing
- Removed irrelevant columns: `Trades`, `Deliverable Volume`, `%Deliverable`
- Handled missing values and symbol inconsistencies
- Adjusted prices for stock splits to avoid misleading volatility

### 🧮 Feature Engineering
- 1-Month Return & Volatility
- SMA (20, 50, 100), RSI, VWAP, Volume

### 🎯 Target Variable
- Multi-class label based on 6-month future return

### 🤖 Modeling
- Algorithms tried: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, XGBoost
- Time-based train-test split to avoid look-ahead bias
- Evaluation metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix

## 📊 Key Learnings

### 📌 Stock Splits Matter
Sudden drops in stock prices were often due to **stock splits**, not market crashes. For example:

- In a 2-for-1 split, each shareholder gets 2 shares for every 1 they owned.
- The share price is halved, but total investment value remains the same.

**Why adjust for splits?**
- To maintain historical price consistency
- Prevents models from misinterpreting split-induced drops as volatility

### 📌 Data Aggregation Helps
- Modeling individual stocks: F1-score ≈ 0.54
- Aggregated multi-stock modeling: F1-score improved to ≈ 0.61

### 📌 API Limitations
- Indian stock APIs don’t reliably return stock split data
- Manual adjustments still required for accurate modeling
